    "Imagine trying to recognize and classify new objects after seeing them just once or a few times. It's a tough task for most machine learning models. This is called few-shot classification. Humans can often identify objects even after seeing them just once. So, how can we make machines do that too?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototype networks work on a basic idea: objects of the same type should be similar to each other in some way. So, in a space where the data is mapped tp, objects from the same class are expected to cluster around a central point, or a 'prototype'. When a new object comes in, the network checks which prototype it's closest to and classifies it accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method not only works for cases where we have a few examples but also for zero-shot learning, where we have no prior examples at all! Instead, we use a high-level description to determine the prototype.\n",

    "\n",
    "Proteins are like intricate puzzles made up of smaller pieces known as amino acids. These tiny building blocks come together in a specific order to give a protein its unique structure and function in living organisms. It's like assembling LEGO blocks in a specific order to build a spaceship or a castle!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine we had a vast library of labels to describe each protein's function. Welcome to SwissProt dataset, which is annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) labels! The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC), an international team of experts, crafted these labels to categorize the role, location, and function of genes across various species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ontology includes over 47,000 terms (as of April 2018), each representing a specific characteristic or label. Think of these labels as descriptors that can be linked together. For instance, a protein might be described by its role in cell division, its location in the cell's nucleus, and its ability to bind to DNA. This results in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of GO labels, where the nodes are the labels and the edges are the relationships between them. When a protein is linked to a specific label, it's also connected to all the labels that are ancestors in the DAG. This makes our machine learning challenge one of multi-label classification, meaning each protein can have multiple labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our exercise on fewshot learning, which mainly focuses on single-label classification, we need a method to assign just one label to each protein. We achieve this by choosing the most detailed label from the GO DAG for every protein. We've provided a procedure (get_samples_using_ic) that does this for you and also loads the dataset in the format you'll need.\n",

This library not only allows to measure the performance of various methods but also facilitates comparisons across multiple datasets. For this exercise, we'll start by examining the `FewShotDataset` template and SwissProt (SP) specialized version, the `SPDataset` before delving into the episodes data set for the SwissProt dataset, `SPSetDataset`, for the episodic training.\n",
