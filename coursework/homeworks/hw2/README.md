## About
This report investigates the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) 
for mutagenicity prediction of chemical compounds. 
The mutagenicity of a chemical compound is a binary attribute indicating whether 
the compound is likely to cause mutations in living organisms. In the context of drug discovery,
this is an important task that ensures the safety of newly developed drugs.

## Get started
First install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or using conda:

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

Then you should be able to run the main notebook.
